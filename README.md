leapmotion-zsh
==============

Custom shortcuts for compiling &amp; running java projects for Leap Motion projects from the command line. To use these commands from the shell, clone the 'leapmotion' directory into your **.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins** directory. If you don't have a *plugins* directory, please create it. Then add '*leapmotion*' (without the quotes) to the **plugins** in your .zshrc file.
